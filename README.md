### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### Aim: To write the prompts for these following prompt types and evaluate that using any one method 1. Straightforward Prompts, 2. Tabular Format Prompting 3.Preceding Question Prompting and 4. Missing Word Prompting

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
1.	Straightforward Prompts:
    - •	"Define photosynthesis in one sentence."
    - 	"List three advantages of electric vehicles."

 3.	Tabular Format Prompting:
     •	"Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table."
     •	"Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each."
3. Preceding Question Prompting:
    •	"Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."
    •	"How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms."
4. Missing Word Prompting:
   •	"The capital of France is ____."
  •	"In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce ____.


1. Straightforward Prompting

Description: Asking the model a direct, clear question.
Prompt Example:

"Explain the process of photosynthesis in simple terms suitable for a 10-year-old."

Expected Output:
A simple, concise explanation of photosynthesis with key steps like sunlight absorption, chlorophyll, water, CO₂, and glucose production.

2. Tabular Format Prompting

Description: Asking the model to produce information in a table, which is useful for comparisons or structured data.
Prompt Example:

"Create a table comparing the three types of rocks (Igneous, Sedimentary, Metamorphic) with columns: Type, Formation Process, Examples."

Expected Output:

Type	Formation Process	Examples
Igneous	Cooling and solidification of magma	Granite, Basalt
Sedimentary	Compaction and cementation of sediments	Sandstone, Limestone
Metamorphic	Transformation due to heat and pressure	Marble, Slate
3. Preceding Question Prompting

Description: Asking the model to answer a question based on a previously given context or question.
Prompt Example:

"Previous question: What is the function of the heart in the human body?
New question: Explain how blood circulation supports the heart's function."

Expected Output:
An answer that links heart function to blood circulation, e.g., "The heart pumps oxygenated blood throughout the body, supplying organs with nutrients. Blood circulation ensures that the heart itself receives oxygen and removes waste."

4. Missing Word Prompting

Description: The model is asked to fill in blanks, useful for testing knowledge or creating interactive learning content.
Prompt Example:

"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert _______ and _______ into glucose using sunlight."

Expected Output:

"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose using sunlight."

Evaluation Method: Zero-Shot Evaluation

Step: Check the model’s output against expected correctness and clarity without providing examples first.

Prompt Type	Accuracy	Clarity	Notes
Straightforward Prompt	High	High	Simple, direct, minimal confusion
Tabular Format Prompting	High	High	Table format ensures clarity, easy comparison
Preceding Question Prompting	Medium-High	Medium	Slight dependency on context, can be verbose
Missing Word Prompting	High	High	Effective for testing knowledge recall


Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.
